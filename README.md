# Design-Automation

This project is based on designing an automated gear train based on tree traversal algorithms like Breadth First Search, 
Depth, First Search, Uniform Cost Search and Path finding algorithms like A* search algorithm.
These algorithms are implemented to design the gear train such that it can transform the required input speed to the output speed
with the smallest set of gears from the specified gear teeth within an error of 2.5%.
The results obtained from these algorithms are compared and validated to analyze the trade offs between them in different practical
applications.
